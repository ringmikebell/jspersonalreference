// objects & their properties and methods

// objects are conceptually similar to tangible, material things in the physical world, 
// like a car, a dog, a set of blueprints, or a laptop.  they have properties that can be described by
// key-value pairs (brand : "apple", size: 15, color : "grey" ).  


// the key can be any string, and the value any number, string, array, boolean, another object, or a function 
// (but called a method when it's a value of an object).


// object syntax:


var computer = {

	//properties
	formFactor: 		"laptop",
	brand: 				"apple",
	size: 				"15",
	material: 			"aluminum"

};

// to reference/use values of an object, use . syntax.

console.log(computer.brand);
console.log(computer.material);
