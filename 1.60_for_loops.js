// for loops


// also known as a counting loop - set (initialize) a counter to a starting value, make a test statement to check if 
// your condition is true, and define how you will iterate (count) through your conditional.  when true, 
// the following code/statements/loop body will be run.

//  for ([initialization]; [test statement]; [iteration])
//  [loopBody];





for (oprahGuest = 0; oprahGuest < 4; oprahGuest++) {
console.log("you get a car!");
}


// you can substitute i for more compact sode


for (i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
console.log("you get a car too!");
}
